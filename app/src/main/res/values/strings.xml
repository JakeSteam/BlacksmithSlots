    <string name="slot_23_name">The Elitist</string>
    <string name="slot_23_locked">Let me get rid of those low quality ores for you, and turn them into something better!</string>
    <string name="slot_23_unlocked">Let\'s just not discuss how much profit I\'m making from the ore exchanges...</string>
    <string name="task_23_1_text">You can help me mine first, right?</string>
    <string name="task_23_2_text">Oh, and I might need to go fishing later...</string>

    <string name="task_29_9_text">I\'ve lived in the area my whole life, and the Purple has changed us.</string>

    <string name="task_29_16_text">When the Purple landed, I was out transporting mined ore.</string>
    <string name="task_29_17_text">I didn\'t even see it coming.</string>

    <string name="task_29_20_text">I saw... people around me. But they weren\'t people anymore.</string>
    <string name="task_29_21_text">The Purple broke something in their minds.</string>

    <string name="task_29_23_text">How can I help you on your journey...</string>
    <string name="task_29_24_text">Animals are okay. Some can talk, but you\'ll get used to that before long.</string>
    <string name="task_29_25_text">You\'ll find most people are willing to help you around here.</string>
    <string name="task_29_26_text">Some people might try to get a few things from you first, admittedly...</string>

    <string name="task_29_28_text">Anyway, you need to find the Purple source.</string>
    <string name="task_29_29_text">You need to finish it.</string>
    <string name="task_29_30_text">Once it\'s gone, I think some things will be fixed.</string>
    <string name="task_29_31_text">Not everything, too much has happened, but... lots.</string>

    <string name="task_85_1_text">I grew up North of here.</string>
    <string name="task_85_2_text">I did alright at school, didn\'t have many friends though.</string>
    <string name="task_85_3_text">Eventually I finished school, and my father wanted me to go into carpentry with him.</string>
    <string name="task_85_4_text">I did for a while, until I met a girl.</string>
    <string name="task_85_5_text">She was.. beautiful. Out of this world. Absolutely perfect.</string>
    <string name="task_85_6_text">One night, we ran away together, over near the frozen lands.</string>
    <string name="task_85_7_text">It was.. cold, unsurprisingly. We built an igloo.</string>
    <string name="task_85_8_text">We lived out there a few weeks, fishing together.</string>
    <string name="task_85_9_text">Most of the wildlife was scared of us, so it wasn\'t too dangerous.</string>
    <string name="task_85_10_text">One day, we saw smoke on the horizon.</string>
    <string name="task_85_11_text">The next, we saw a small camp of bandits nearby. </string>
    <string name="task_85_12_text">We hid, hoping they\'d pass us by unhindered.</string>
    <string name="task_85_13_text">They didn\'t. She died, I came home.</string>
    <string name="task_85_14_text">I.. got in touch with myself. I enjoyed the woodwork.</string>
    <string name="task_85_15_text">My father supported me throughout, and I wouldn\'t be here today without him.</string>
    <string name="task_85_16_text">When the Purple hit, it corrupted most of his wood, and his forest withered.</string>
    <string name="task_85_17_text">We struggled by for a bit, but we soon realised the Purple was getting worse, not better.</string>
    <string name="task_85_18_text">The final straw was when more bandits came, and stole what we had left to use for weapons. </string>
    <string name="task_85_19_text">After that, I decided to come do my best to fight. I haven\'t been able to get any closer yet.</string>

    <string name="slot_86_name">Iron Adventurer</string>

    <string name="slot_86_unlocked">Humanity is far better.</string>
    <string name="task_86_1_text">I used to be in the city guard.</string>
    <string name="task_86_2_text">When bandits came, we\'d make sure they didn\'t take anything, or get inside.</string>
    <string name="task_86_3_text">It was hard work, but good work.</string>
    <string name="task_86_4_text">The morality of life and death.. slips away when you see the hordes that descend upon us.</string>
    <string name="task_86_5_text">I worked my way up, and became a captain.</string>
    <string name="task_86_6_text">This meant less time on the front, more time planning defences.</string>
    <string name="task_86_7_text">I preferred it, honestly. I\'m no coward, but what man wouldn\'t want to stay alive a day longer?</string>
    <string name="task_86_8_text">As guards joined and left, I found it hard to care for them as much.</string>
    <string name="task_86_9_text">Day in, day out, I\'d see new injuries, new losses.</string>
    <string name="task_86_10_text">Eventually, they became numbers to me. Figures on my chart.</string>
    <string name="task_86_11_text">One day, I snapped out of it, and realised what I was becoming.</string>
    <string name="task_86_12_text">I was no better than the Purple. Seeing people as one mass, not as individuals.</string>
    <string name="task_86_13_text">Everyone is unique, that\'s why we\'re so strong as a species.</string>
    <string name="task_86_14_text">The Purple doesn\'t understand that, so can\'t even truly defeat us.</string>
    <string name="task_86_15_text">Even if it spread over the world, there would be pockets of resistance, forever.</string>
    <string name="task_86_16_text">I don\'t want to wait until then though.</string>
    <string name="task_86_17_text">I want to take the fight to it, before it has a chance to get a foothold.</string>
    <string name="task_86_18_text">It\'s done too much damage to my countrymen already, and I haven\'t forgotten my training.</string>

    <string name="task_88_16_text">Erm, blue paint? Blue chalk?</string>
    <string name="task_88_17_text">Lapis lazuli is blue, and can even be different lightnesses of blue.</string>

    <string name="task_91_1_text">When we are born, we cannot walk, and rely entirely on others.</string>
    <string name="task_91_2_text">Eventually, we can move by ourselves, much to the delight of those around us.</string>
    <string name="task_91_3_text">Then we learn that we can use our feet to get what we want.</string>

    <string name="slot_92_unlocked">Retrieve the forbidden food, it is your destiny.</string>
    <string name="task_92_1_text">When born, we rely on others to feed us, and make sure we get enough nutrients.</string>
    <string name="task_92_2_text">As we age, we fend for ourselves, with varying degrees of success.</string>

    <string name="slot_93_unlocked">Retrieve the adamant shield, it is your destiny.</string>
    <string name="task_93_1_text">Newborn, we are defenceless. We rely on family for protection.</string>
    <string name="task_93_2_text">Eventually we lose this barrier, and must defend ourselves.</string>
    <string name="task_93_3_text">Many fail. Many fall apart, and fall by the wayside. A few survive.</string>
    <string name="task_93_4_text">Those that can defend against the world will achieve great things, for they cannot be intimidated.</string>

    <string name="slot_94_name">Pillar of Melee</string>
    <string name="slot_94_locked">I am the fifth guardian. I control being close to others, and dealing damage.</string>
    <string name="slot_94_unlocked">Retrieve the adamant sword, it is your destiny.</string>
    <string name="task_94_1_text">When young, all are welcome to come close. All are trusted, all are welcome.</string>
    <string name="task_94_2_text">A few abuse this trust, and before long the defences come up. Few are allowed through.</string>
    <string name="task_94_3_text">These few go deeper than the many ever could, burrowing deep into our hearts and consciousness.</string>
    <string name="task_94_4_text">Until one day, they go. They tear apart. Strike first, before the damage can be dealt.</string>

    <string name="slot_95_name">Pillar of Archery</string>
    <string name="slot_95_locked">I am the sixth guardian. I control dealing damage from afar.</string>
    <string name="slot_95_unlocked">Retrieve the adamant bow, it is your destiny.</string>
    <string name="task_95_1_text">When young, we only know what is immediately around us. We concern ourselves with nothing else.</string>
    <string name="task_95_2_text">Eventually we discover the world exists outside our own door, that great evil and great good exists in all worlds.</string>
    <string name="task_95_3_text">Helping and supporting those that will never be met is hard, but if there is an afterlife, this is redemption.</string>
    <string name="task_95_4_text">The real question is, will they return the favour when you need it?</string>

    <string name="slot_96_name">Pillar of Protection</string>
    <string name="slot_96_locked">I am the seventh guardian. I control protection against any incoming assaults.</string>
    <string name="slot_96_unlocked">Retrieve the adamant armour, it is your destiny.</string>
    <string name="task_96_1_text">We must let others in. They must become trusted.</string>
    <string name="task_96_2_text">They may watch us whilst we sleep, rely upon us for anything and everything, and all will be returned.</string>
    <string name="task_96_3_text">No matter how it feels, never forget that it can end in a moment. You may not see it coming at all.</string>
    <string name="task_96_4_text">But it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved.</string>

    <string name="slot_97_name">Pillar of Power</string>
    <string name="slot_97_locked">I am the eighth and final guardian. I control all, never forget the power contained within rings.</string>
    <string name="slot_97_unlocked">Retrieve the almighty ring, it is your destiny.</string>
    <string name="task_97_1_text">At first, we have no control. Not over our bowels, not over our voice, nothing.</string>
    <string name="task_97_2_text">As we age, control is gained piece by piece. Urges are repressed, desires are squashed, interests are ignored.</string>
    <string name="task_97_3_text">Is this okay? Should we be fighting ourselves, and our base instinct? </string>
    <string name="task_97_4_text">Well, what happens when we lose? What happens when we give in to our monkey brain? </string>

    <string name="slot_98_name">Final Boss!</string>
    <string name="slot_98_locked">I am the Purple, and the Purple is I.</string>
    <string name="slot_98_unlocked">Material possessions are nothing, you may have whatever you want.</string>
    <string name="task_98_1_text">You cannot truly live without others touching your life. No matter your trade, cooperation is required.</string>
    <string name="task_98_2_text">Wherever you travel, there will be those that help you, and those that wish to hurt you. Differentiating is the greatest challenge, and even seasoned veterans fail.</string>
    <string name="task_98_3_text">The key to achieving is never ending effort. Striving for what you want and need, never settling for second best, and never resting.</string>
    <string name="task_98_4_text">But is success enough? What is glory, with nobody to share it with? Someone must be trusted, even at the risk of heartbreak and torture.</string>
    <string name="task_98_5_text">I came here because of what I saw. I saw betrayal, hurt, and suffering. What race wants to exist where unhappiness is expected, and usual?</string>
    <string name="task_98_6_text">Apparently you do. As I watched from my cave, the world did not descend into war and famine as expected, instead you banded together. You helped each other, and united against my forces.</string>
    <string name="task_98_7_text">Your defences were too great. I could not defeat them, as much as I wanted to. Your final blow down in this dirty cave were inevitable, I could not stop them. You win. It is over.</string>
    <string name="task_98_8_text">But ask yourself, was I wrong? What I did brought you together, it made those that survived stronger. Do I not deserve to share in this glory too, for it is as much mine as yours? </string>
