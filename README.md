About Developer:

Blacksmith Slots is a spin-off from my first game "Pixel Blacksmith", and is created and maintained by Jake Lee, a software engineer from England. If you've encountered a bug, or have an idea for a new feature, please mention it in a review or on https://reddit.com/r/BlacksmithSlots and I'll reply ASAP. I appreciate all feedback!

Happy spinning, blacksmiths!

## Codebase notes
* `SlotHelper.java` contains all of the slot spinning / rewarding logic.
* `Enums.java` contains most of the game data definition, with `DatabaseHelper.java` storing the rest.
* It requires an older version of Android Studio to build, and likely a lot of changes.
